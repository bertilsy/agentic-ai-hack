Limitations include that you are responsible for any damages exceeding the policy limits, and there is no medical coverage for your injuries (Section 7.3: Financial Responsibility). The policy requires claims to be promptly reported and your cooperation throughout the claims process (Section 7.1 and 7.2). Conditions include meeting state minimum liability coverage requirements at all times, with penalties for driving without insurance (Section 8.1). There are no coverages for your own vehicle repairs or personal injuries, and it is advised to consider an umbrella policy for additional protection against liabilities beyond policy limits (Sections 7.3 and 8.2). In summary, the main exclusions are no coverage for your own vehicle or injury, and responsibility for damages beyond limits.
